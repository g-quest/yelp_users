# yelp_users

This script (work in progress) is used for analyzing the Yelp users dataset downloaded from their latest Academic Challenge. The focus of this analysis is on how the number of reviews written by an individual user (dependent variable) is influenced by the types and number of compliments (independent variables) they receive from other users. The aim is to see an analogous relationship to other social media platforms ('likes' on Instagram, 'comments'/'reactions' on Facebook, etc), and to gain an overall sense of how user behavior changes as the user receives positive feedback from others.

Formal review to follow.
